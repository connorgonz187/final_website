        I am also a lifeguard, I have been lifeguarding for two years, going on
        three. Recently I obtained my instructor certification, allowing me to
        teach new guards the Red Cross course. Through lifeguarding, I have
        obtained many people skills and learned professionalism, all of which
        have affected me in my daily life.

        One of my main hobbies is photography. I have been pursuing photography
        since I was a kid and I love doing it. Over time, I have learned how to
        take different types of photos and videos. Recently, I have gotten into
        drones, opening a whole new door to the hobby.
