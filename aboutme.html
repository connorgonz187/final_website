      I’m Connor Gonzalez, I am a high school senior at Kettering Fairmont with
      a passion for technology and computers. I have run cross country and done
      swimming for four years. Currently, I am working as an intern at The
      Education Connection (TEC). There, I work on configuring and setting up
      connected speakers at schools and buildings across Ohio.

      I am also a lifeguard, I have been lifeguarding for two years, going on
      three. Recently I obtained my instructor certification, allowing me to
      teach new guards the Red Cross course. Through lifeguarding, I have
      obtained many people skills and learned professionalism, all of which have
      affected me in my daily life.

      One of my main hobbies is <a href="photography.html">photography</a>. I
      have been pursuing photography since I was a kid and I love doing it. Over
      time, I have learned how to take different types of photos and videos.
      Recently, I have gotten into drones, opening a whole new door to the
      hobby.
